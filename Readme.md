This is a Wordle variant made for a work hackathon. Sorry the code is a mess, I was moving fast and doing a lot of things for the first time. You can probably run it yourself with the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

Then go to [the game](http://localhost:8000). Everyday it will randomly select a current NFL player. The game is to figure out the hidden player by guessing any NFL player and the game will tell you if the hidden player plays for the same team and position and if there Jersey and Debut year are greater or less than your guessed player. You have as many guesses as you want.

If I was to develop the game more I would add the following features:
* Histogram of daily scores
* Hard mode which turns off autocomplete
* Dark mode
* Conference and Division in addition to team
* Maybe I would select notable NFL players instead of random ones who no one has heard of.
